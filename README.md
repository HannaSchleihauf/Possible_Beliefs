## Overview

This repository contains a preregistration, data, code, ans the manuscript and 
supplement for a project entitled 
‘Children and adults’ intuitions of what people can believe’.

Two pre-registered studies tested how 5-6-year-olds, 7-8-year-olds, and adults 
judged the possibility of holding alternative beliefs. In Study 1 (N=120, 
52 females, mostly white), children and adults thought people could hold 
alternative beliefs when their initial beliefs were not supported by evidence. 
However, when their initial beliefs were supported by evidence, children and 
adults thought people could not hold different beliefs. In Study 2 
(N=120, 58 females, mostly white), children and adults thought people could 
hold different beliefs when their initial beliefs were opinions or immoral 
beliefs. However, when people held moral beliefs, children and adults thought 
people could not form other beliefs. Young children viewed moral beliefs as 
more constrained than adults. Our results suggest that young children already 
have sophisticated intuitions of the possibility of holding various beliefs 
and how certain beliefs are constrained.
